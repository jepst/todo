Minimal "To-Do app" web application
===========

We provide three iterations of development of a simple web app to demonstrate different approaches. The intended order of study is as follows:

1. [Local version](todo-local). Purely client-side, uses cookies for storage.
2. [Server version](todo-server). Adds a flask-based API server.
3. [Docker version](todo-docker). A dockerized version with a MySQL database.
